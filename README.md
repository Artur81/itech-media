## Introduction:

Hi,
I used Laravel just to quick start with MVC.

Forgive me please, that my front end part is so basic. Last 7 years I worked as backend developer on REST apis, but my goal is to broaden my knowledge in this respect.

## Requirements:
- PHP7
- Composer

## How to run:
1. run: composer install
2. copy .env.example as .env and fill TWITTER_API section
3. run: php artisan serve
4. check http://127.0.0.1:8000/
